# hello-world
My first repository.

My name is Abigail Schaaf. I am a remote sensing specialist and project manager for RedCastle Resources. I like to read magazines backwards, am a mother to an adorable little girl named Lydia, am married to a handsome and daring man named Stephen; I love animals, skiing, hiking, being with my friends, and exploring new places. 
My favorite foods are nachos, pizza and french fries. However, I tend to eat these things on just rare occasions.
